  "description": "Given a text string stored in the variable `text`, compute three things:\n\n1. `total_chars` — the total number of characters in the text.\n2. `unique_chars` — a **sorted** list of all unique characters that appear in the text.\n3. `vocab_size` — the number of unique characters (i.e., the size of the character vocabulary).\n\nThese values are the foundation for building a character-level language model: you need to know what characters exist before you can map them to numbers.",
