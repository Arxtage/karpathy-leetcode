  "description": "Given the function `f(a, b, c) = a*b + c`, implement `partial_derivatives(a, b, c, h=1e-5)` that returns a dict `{'da': ..., 'db': ..., 'dc': ...}` containing the partial derivative of `f` with respect to each variable.\n\nA partial derivative measures how the output changes when you nudge one input while holding the others fixed.",
